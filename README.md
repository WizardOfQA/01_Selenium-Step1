# Selenium_UI_Automation
## Description:
This Selenium UI Automatin Framework tests many different functionalities for various websites. Since I don't control nor maintain these websites, some tests might be broken as these webistes are being updated. But as of 4/5/2018, every test in this framework works fine!!!
This is the first part of the entire series of Selenium_UI_Automation.  

### Roadmap for Selenium UI Test Automation Series:
**1. Selenium_UI_Automation With no POM model**
2. Selenium_UI_Automation With POM
3. Selenium_UI_Automation With Logging and Reporting Functionalities.(Extent Report)  
I might add more series as needed to showcase UI Automation with Selenium.
